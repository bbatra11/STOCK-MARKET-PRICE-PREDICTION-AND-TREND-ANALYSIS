# STOCK-MARKET-PRICE-PREDICTION-AND-TREND-ANALYSIS

### OVERVIEW
The Stock Market does not follow any fixed pattern and is affected by several factors. So, an investor needs to be watchful of the market behavior before investing in any stock. The stock market data is available everywhere but analyzing all this information physically is not easy. The objective of this project is to investigate the trends and factors affecting the stock prices and then predict stock closing prices using data mining techniques.

### DATASET
The Dataset for this project is obtained from NASDAQ's official website. NASDAQ is one index that highly attracts growth-oriented companies. It is one of the largest stock exchanges based on market capitalization. The Dataset is of 1 year for 12 different companies.

### DATA MINING TASKS
Some data mining tasks were performed on the dataset before implementing Prediction Models. These majorly include Data Preprocessing, Data Transformation, Exploratory Data Analysis and CATCH22 AND VARIABLE SELECTION.
Used feature extraction technique Catch22 on closing price.

### DATA MINING MODELS
This involves training Machine Learning models with the feature selection and hyperparameter tuning for predicting closing prices of stocks. Multiple models like Linear Regression, KNN, Random Forest and Neural Network were trained for this purpose and a comparative analysis was done to choose the best performing model. Since this was a regression problem, R-squared, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were considered as the evaluation metrics.
